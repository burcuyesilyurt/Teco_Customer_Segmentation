# Description:

For this task, I will develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn, a common business problem. Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses as it helps in identifying customers who are likely to stop using a service or product, allowing the company to take proactive steps to retain them.

## Dataset Selection
I'll use the popular "Telco Customer Churn" dataset, which contains information about customers of a telecom company. The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, account information, and services used, as well as a label indicating whether the customer churned or not.

## Problem Definition
The problem is a binary classification task, where the goal is to predict whether a customer will churn (1) or not churn (0) based on the features provided in the dataset.

## Challenges:
Handling class imbalance if the dataset has more non-churned customers than churned ones.
Avoiding overfitting.
